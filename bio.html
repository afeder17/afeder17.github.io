<h2> Life story </h2>
<h3> Andrew Feder was born in New York in 1997. He has a younger sister, Jamie, and a dog he 
often takes care of, Golda. He enjoys long walks on the beach, but mostly just to collect sand 
samples, as in addition to comp sci, he is also a geology major. In his spare time, Andrew likes to 
ponder the bigger questions in life: "Who am I?" Why am I here?" "Who are you people?" "Why is 
there so much cheese?" He also works as a TA for comp 11. </h3>
